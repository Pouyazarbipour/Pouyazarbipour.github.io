Dedicated and skilled Civil Engineer specialized in coastal, ports, and marine structures, with a Masterâ€™s degree from  [Tarbiat Modares University](https://modares.ac.ir). Proven expertise in reliability-based design optimization, Risk and Resilience, and deep learning applications in coastal and marine structures engineering. Recognized for academic excellence with multiple fellowships and a passion for innovative marine engineering solutions. Seeking to leverage my research and project management skills to contribute to sustainable and efficient marine infrastructure development.

student at Cornell University, working on the intersection of AI and Science, advised by Prof. Carla P. Gomes. In the past, he spent time at AMLab at University of Amsterdam advised by Prof. Max Welling and DP Technology supervised by Dr. Linfeng Zhang. He also spent time at Microsoft Research Asia, Machine Learning group. He is a passionate community builder, which he founded the series of [*AI for Science workshops*](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), co-founded the [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/), and led an initiative [*AI for Science 101*](https://ai4science101.github.io/) building knowledge systems for AI for Science. He received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. He maintains a slack channel for AI for Science, feel free to join and say Hi to people [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aiforscience/shared_invite/zt-1bdof1jmf-YtIjkUVA5DquXguEiOXGPQ)!

<!-- He is very fascinated by Science and interested in developing ML tools for scientific problems, especially for new knowledge discovery. On the other side, as a computer sciencist, he is devoted to understanding the world through a computational perspective. He is actively collaborating with researchers in applied mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science.
